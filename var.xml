<chapter id='theVarHierarchy'><title>The /var Hierarchy</title>

<section id='purpose31'><title>Purpose</title>

<para><filename>/var</filename> contains variable data files.  This
includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data,
and transient and temporary files.</para>

<para>Some portions of <filename>/var</filename> are not shareable
between different systems.  For instance,
<filename>/var/log</filename>, <filename >/var/lock</filename>, and
<filename>/var/run</filename>.  Other portions may be shared, notably
<filename>/var/mail</filename>, <filename >/var/cache/man</filename>,
<filename>/var/cache/fonts</filename>, and
<filename>/var/spool/news</filename>.</para>

<para><filename>/var</filename> is specified here in order to make it
possible to mount <filename>/usr</filename> read-only.  Everything
that once went into <filename>/usr</filename> that is written to
during system operation (as opposed to installation and software
maintenance) must be in <filename>/var</filename>.</para>

<para>If <filename>/var</filename> cannot be made a separate
partition, it is often preferable to move <filename>/var</filename>
out of the root partition and into the <filename>/usr</filename>
partition.  (This is sometimes done to reduce the size of the root
partition or when space runs low in the root partition.)  However,
<filename>/var</filename> must not be linked to
<filename>/usr</filename> because this makes separation of
<filename>/usr</filename> and <filename>/var</filename> more difficult
and is likely to create a naming conflict.  Instead, link
<filename>/var</filename> to <filename>/usr/var</filename>.</para>

<para>Applications must generally not add directories to the top level
of <filename>/var</filename>.  Such directories should only be added
if they have some system-wide implication, and in consultation with
the FHS mailing list.</para>

<section id='varcacheApplicationCacheData'>
<title>/var/cache : Application cache data</title>

<section id='purpose33'><title>Purpose</title>

<para><filename>/var/cache</filename> is intended for cached data from
applications.  Such data is locally generated as a result of
time-consuming I/O or calculation.  The application must be able to
regenerate or restore the data.  Unlike
<filename>/var/spool</filename>, the cached files can be deleted
without data loss.  The data must remain valid between invocations of
the application and rebooting the system.</para>

<para>Files located under <filename>/var/cache</filename> may be
expired in an application specific manner, by the system
administrator, or both.  The application must always be able to
recover from manual deletion of these files (generally because of a
disk space shortage).  No other requirements are made on the data
format of the cache directories.</para>


<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para>The existence of a separate directory for cached data allows
system administrators to set different disk and backup policies from
other directories in <filename>/var</filename>.</para>

<section id='varcachefontsLocallygeneratedFonts'>
<title>/var/cache/fonts : Locally-generated fonts (optional)</title>

<section id='purpose34'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>The directory <filename>/var/cache/fonts</filename> should be used to store any
dynamically-created fonts.  In particular, all of the fonts which are
automatically generated by <command>mktexpk</command> must be located in
appropriately-named subdirectories of <filename>/var/cache/fonts</filename>.

<footnote>

<section id='varcachemanLocallyformattedManualPag'>
<title>/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)</title>

<section id='purpose35'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This directory provides a standard location for sites that provide a
read-only <filename>/usr</filename> partition, but wish to allow caching of
locally-formatted man pages.  Sites that mount <filename>/usr</filename> as writable
(e.g., single-user installations) may choose not to use
<filename>/var/cache/man</filename> and may write formatted man pages into the
<filename>cat&lt;section&gt;</filename> directories in <filename>/usr/share/man</filename> directly.  We
recommend that most sites use one of the following options instead:</para>
<itemizedlist spacing="normal" mark="bullet">
<listitem>
<para>Preformat all manual pages alongside the unformatted versions.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Allow no caching of formatted man pages, and require formatting to be
done each time a man page is brought up.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Allow local caching of formatted man pages in <filename>/var/cache/man</filename>.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The structure of <filename>/var/cache/man</filename> needs to
reflect both the fact of multiple man page hierarchies and the
possibility of multiple language support.</para>

<para>Given an unformatted manual page that normally appears in
<filename>&lt;path&gt;/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;</filename>,
the directory to place formatted man pages in is
<filename>/var/cache/man/&lt;catpath&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/cat&lt;section&gt;</filename>,
where <filename>&lt;catpath&gt;</filename> is derived from
<filename>&lt;path&gt;</filename> by removing any leading
<filename>usr</filename> and/or trailing <filename>share</filename>
pathname components.  (Note that the
<filename>&lt;locale&gt;</filename> component may be missing.)

<footnote><para>
For example, <filename>/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1</filename> is
formatted into <filename>/var/cache/man/cat1/ls.1</filename>, and
<filename>/usr/X11R6/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man3/XtClass.3x</filename> into
<filename>/var/cache/man/X11R6/&lt;locale&gt;/cat3/XtClass.3x</filename>.
</para>
</footnote></para>

<para>Man pages written to <filename>/var/cache/man</filename> may
eventually be transferred to the appropriate preformatted directories
in the source <filename>man</filename> hierarchy or expired; likewise
formatted man pages in the source <filename>man</filename> hierarchy
may be expired if they are not accessed for a period of time.</para>

<para>If preformatted manual pages come with a system on read-only
media (a CD-ROM, for instance), they must be installed in the source
<filename>man</filename> hierarchy
(e.g. <filename>/usr/share/man/cat&lt;section&gt;</filename>).
<filename>/var/cache/man</filename> is reserved as a writable cache
for formatted manual pages.</para>


<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para>Release 1.2 of the standard specified
<filename>/var/catman</filename> for this hierarchy.  The path has
been moved under <filename>/var/cache</filename> to better reflect the
dynamic nature of the formatted man pages.  The directory name has
been changed to <filename>man</filename> to allow for enhancing the
hierarchy to include post-processed formats other than "cat", such as
PostScript, HTML, or DVI.</para>

<section id='varcrashSystemCrashDumps'>
<title>/var/crash : System crash dumps (optional)</title>


<section id='purpose36'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This directory holds system crash dumps.  As of the date of this
release of the standard, system crash dumps were not supported under
Linux but may be supported by other systems which may comply with the
FHS.</para>

<section id='vargamesVariableGameData'>

<title>/var/games : Variable game data (optional)</title>


<section id='purpose37'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>Any variable data relating to games in <filename>/usr</filename>
should be placed here.  <filename>/var/games</filename> should hold
the variable data previously found in <filename>/usr</filename>;
static data, such as help text, level descriptions, and so on, must
remain elsewhere, such as
<filename>/usr/share/games</filename>.</para>


<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para><filename>/var/games</filename> has been given a hierarchy of
its own, rather than leaving it merged in with the old
<filename>/var/lib</filename> as in release 1.2.  The separation
allows local control of backup strategies, permissions, and disk
usage, as well as allowing inter-host sharing and reducing clutter in
<filename>/var/lib</filename>.  Additionally,
<filename>/var/games</filename> is the path traditionally used by BSD.</para>

</tip>
</section>
</section>

<section id='varlibVariableStateInformation'>
<title>/var/lib : Variable state information</title>

<section id='purpose38'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an
application or the system.  State information is data that programs
modify while they run, and that pertains to one specific host.  Users
must never need to modify files in <filename>/var/lib</filename> to
configure a package's operation, and the specific file hierarchy
used to store the data must not be exposed to regular users.

<footnote><para>
Data with exposed filesystem structure should be stored in
<filename>/srv</filename>.
</para></footnote>
</para>

<para>State information is generally used to preserve the condition of
an application (or a group of inter-related applications) between
invocations and between different instances of the same application.
State information should generally remain valid after a reboot, should
not be logging output, and should not be spooled data.</para>

<para>An application (or a group of inter-related applications) must
use a subdirectory of <filename>/var/lib</filename> for its data.
There is one required subdirectory,
<filename>/var/lib/misc</filename>, which is intended for state files
that don't need a subdirectory; the other subdirectories should only
be present if the application in question is included in the
distribution.

<footnote>
<para>
An important difference between this version of this standard and
previous ones is that applications are now required to use a
subdirectory of <filename>/var/lib</filename>.  
</para>
</footnote></para>

<para><filename>/var/lib/&lt;name&gt;</filename> is the location that
must be used for all distribution packaging support.  Different
distributions may use different names, of course.</para>

<section id='varliblteditorgtEditorBackupFilesAn'>
<title>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; : Editor backup files and state (optional)</title>

<section id='purpose39'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>These directories contain saved files generated by any
unexpected termination of an editor (e.g., <command>elvis</command>,
<command>jove</command>, <command>nvi</command>).</para>

<para>Other editors may not require a directory for crash-recovery
files, but may require a well-defined place to store other information
while the editor is running.  This information should be stored in a
subdirectory under <filename>/var/lib</filename> (for example, GNU
Emacs would place lock files in
<filename>/var/lib/emacs/lock</filename>).</para>

<para>Future editors may require additional state information beyond
crash-recovery files and lock files &mdash; this information should
also be placed under
<filename>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt;</filename>.</para>

<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para>Previous Linux releases, as well as all commercial vendors, use
<filename>/var/preserve</filename> for vi or its clones.  However,
each editor uses its own format for these crash-recovery files, so a
separate directory is needed for each editor.</para>

<para>Editor-specific lock files are usually quite different from the
device or resource lock files that are stored in
<filename>/var/lock</filename> and, hence, are stored under
<filename>/var/lib</filename>.</para>

<tip>

<title>/var/lib/misc : Miscellaneous variable data</title>

<section id='purpose41'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This directory contains variable data not placed in a
subdirectory in <filename>/var/lib</filename>.  An attempt should be
made to use relatively unique names in this directory to avoid
namespace conflicts.

<footnote><para>This hierarchy should contain files stored in

<section id='varlockLockFiles'>
<title>/var/lock : Lock files</title>

<section id='purpose42'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>Lock files should be stored within the
<filename>/var/lock</filename> directory structure.</para>

<para>Lock files for devices and other resources shared by multiple
applications, such as the serial device lock files that were
originally found in either <filename>/usr/spool/locks</filename> or
<filename>/usr/spool/uucp</filename>, must now be stored in
<filename>/var/lock</filename>.  The naming convention which must be
used is "LCK.." followed by the base name of the device.  For example,
to lock /dev/ttyS0 the file "LCK..ttyS0" would be created.

<footnote>
<para>Then, anything wishing to use <filename>/dev/ttyS0</filename>
can read the lock file and act accordingly (all locks in
<filename>/var/lock</filename> should be world-readable).
</para>
</footnote></para>

<para>The format used for the contents of such lock files must be the
HDB UUCP lock file format.  The HDB format is to store the process
identifier (PID) as a ten byte ASCII decimal number, with a trailing
newline.  For example, if process 1230 holds a lock file, it would
contain the eleven characters: space, space, space, space, space,
space, one, two, three, zero, and newline.</para>

<para>The logical location for this directory was changed from

<section id='varrunRuntimeVariableData'>
<title>/var/run : Run-time variable data</title>

<section id='purpose46'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This directory contains system information data describing the
system since it was booted.  Files under this directory must be
cleared (removed or truncated as appropriate) at the beginning of the
boot process.  Programs may have a subdirectory of
<filename>/var/run</filename>; this is encouraged for programs that
use more than one run-time file.

<footnote>
<para>
<filename>/var/run</filename> should be unwritable for unprivileged
users (root or users running daemons); it is a major security problem
if any user can write in this directory.
</para>
</footnote>

Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally placed in
<filename>/etc</filename>, must be placed in
<filename>/var/run</filename>.  The naming convention for PID files is
<filename>&lt;program-name&gt;.pid</filename>.  For example, the
<command>crond</command> PID file is named
<filename>/var/run/crond.pid</filename>.</para>

</section>

<section id='requirements14'><title>Requirements</title>

<para>The internal format of PID files remains unchanged.  The file
must consist of the process identifier in ASCII-encoded decimal,
followed by a newline character.  For example, if
<command>crond</command> was process number 25,
<filename>/var/run/crond.pid</filename> would contain three
characters: two, five, and newline.</para>

<para>Programs that read PID files should be somewhat flexible in what
they accept; i.e., they should ignore extra whitespace, leading
zeroes, absence of the trailing newline, or additional lines in the
PID file.  Programs that create PID files should use the simple
specification located in the above paragraph.</para>

<para>The <filename>utmp</filename> file, which stores information
about who is currently using the system, is located in this

<para>The lock file for <command>lpd</command>,
<filename>lpd.lock</filename>, must be placed in
<filename>/var/spool/lpd</filename>.  It is suggested that the lock
file for each printer be placed in the spool directory for that
specific printer and named <filename>lock</filename>.</para>

<title>/var/spool/rwho : Rwhod files (optional)</title>


<section id='purpose49'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>This directory holds the <command>rwhod</command> information
for other systems on the local net.</para>

<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para>Some BSD releases use <filename>/var/rwho</filename> for this
data; given its historical location in <filename>/var/spool</filename>
on other systems and its approximate fit to the definition of
`spooled' data, this location was deemed more appropriate.</para>

<section id='vartmpTemporaryFilesPreservedBetwee'>
<title>/var/tmp : Temporary files preserved between system reboots</title>

<section id='purpose50'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>The <filename>/var/tmp</filename> directory is made available
for programs that require temporary files or directories that are
preserved between system reboots.  Therefore, data stored in
<filename>/var/tmp</filename> is more persistent than data in
<filename>/tmp</filename>.</para>

<para>Files and directories located in <filename>/var/tmp</filename>
must not be deleted when the system is booted.  Although data stored
in <filename>/var/tmp</filename> is typically deleted in a
site-specific manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less
frequent interval than <filename>/tmp</filename>.</para>

<section id='varypNetworkInformationService'>
<title>/var/yp : Network Information Service (NIS) database files (optional)</title>


<section id='purpose51'><title>Purpose</title>

<para>Variable data for the Network Information Service (NIS),
formerly known as the Sun Yellow Pages (YP), must be placed in this
directory.</para>

<tip><title>Rationale</title>

<para><filename>/var/yp</filename> is the standard directory for NIS
(YP) data and is almost exclusively used in NIS documentation and
systems.

<footnote>
<para>
NIS should not be confused with Sun NIS+, which uses a different
directory, <filename>/var/nis</filename>.
